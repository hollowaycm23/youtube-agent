Every advancement in model intelligence for coding has encouraged us to rethink how development should be done. The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of today is a far cry from the IDE of just a few years ago. Gemini 3, our most intelligent model, represents a step-change for agentic coding, and requires us to think about what the next step-change of an IDE should be.

Today, we are introducing Google Antigravity, our new agentic development platform. While the core is a familiar AI-powered IDE experience with the best of Google’s models, Antigravity is evolving the IDE towards an agent-first future with browser control capabilities, asynchronous interaction patterns, and an agent-first product form factor that together, enable agents to autonomously plan and execute complex, end-to-end software tasks.

Why We Built Antigravity
We want Antigravity to be the home base for software development in the era of agents. Our vision is to ultimately enable anyone with an idea to experience liftoff and build that idea into reality. From today, Google Antigravity is available in public preview at no charge, with generous rate limits on Gemini 3 Pro usage.

With models like Gemini 3, we have started hitting the point in agentic intelligence where models are capable of running for longer periods of time without intervention across multiple surfaces. Not yet for days at a time without intervention, but we’re getting closer to a world where we interface with agents at higher abstractions over individual prompts and tool calls. In this world, the product surface that enables communication between the agent and user should look and feel different - and Antigravity is our answer to this.
